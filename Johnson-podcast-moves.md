#Common Moves in Podcasting
The two titles I chose to use for the common moves assignment are "Authentic Social Media Marketing" by Jenna Kutcher and "How to Sell on Instagram" by Michael Stelzner. These podcasts are both in the business genre. I thought it would be interesting to listen to podcasts I could use in my profession and at my current job. I've been doing a lot of social media recently, so that's where I decided to start with my search for podcasts. 

##Introduction
What I have found is that there is always an introduction that usually starts with music and introduces the podcast and the speaker.  
* In the podcast "Authentic Social Media Marketing" by Jenna Kutcher, the introduction included catchy music followed by a welcome. This was her pilot podcast, so she took a bit of extra time giving some background on who she was, why and how she decided to start a podcast, and her plans for this podcast as well as future episodes. Her introduction gives listeners insight into her life and perspective, giving her credibility for what she discussed in this episode as well as in the episodes following.
* In the podcast "How to Sell on Instagram" by Michael Stelzner, the introduction also begins with music, a welcome, and an introduction of the host. Unlike in Kutcher's podcast, the host does not initially introduce himself, but he is introduced by some animated announcer. There is also a provider website mentioned, as well as a sponsor for the podcast. Stelzner then gives a quick overview of what this episode will entail, including who will be joining him as a guest, and then provides a way to get in touch with him via email.

##Main content
* Kutcher's main content was a long continuous monologue. There weren't really any breaks in the content, and therefore no real need for transitions outside of the intro and outro. The content was both anecdotal and informative.
* Stelzner's main content included a few elements, but the vast majority of the time was spent with the interview element. Between each part of the podcast, Stelzner included a transition, as discussed below.

##Interview
* Kutcher did not include an interview in her first episode of her podcast. However, she did allude to the potential for interviews in future episodes. Again, this was a pilot episode, so is makes sense that she does not start off her podcast series with an interview because she was spending time introducing herself and her perspective and goal for future episodes.
* The majority of Stelzner's podcast episode was spent interviewing an Instagram professional about how to make your use of Instagram more effective for your business. This interview was relevant and informative, as the information and advice on Instagram use came from quality guiding questions by the host and answers from a credible and knowledgeable source.

##Transitions
* Kutcher did not use transitions outside of intro and outro music at the beginning and end of the podcast.
* Stelzner included a transition by the same music and voice as in the introduction in between his introduction and the start of his first conversation.
* As another example, "Homecoming" had very clear transitions between scenes, marked by a certain noise. Despite being fictional, in contrast with the podcasts I chose, clear transitions between parts were still an essential part of the podcast.

##Outro
* In Kutcher's outro, she told listeners where to find the show notes for the episode and said a quick "see you next time." There was also accompanying exit music.
* Very similarly, in his outro, Stelzner gave the interviewee a chance to tell listeners how to contact her and how to connect with her on social media. He thanked her, and then thanked the viewers for listening. He also told listeners where to get the podcast notes, and did another plug for the sponsor. The same voice and music from the intro and transitions came in right at the end to do a quick plug for the producer.

##Extras
* There are also extraneous podcast elements that are worth mentioning. Sound effects are extremely important and widely used, but mostly in fiction podcasts such as "Homecoming." The non-fiction podcasts I chose to listen to did not make use of sound effects past the transition music.
